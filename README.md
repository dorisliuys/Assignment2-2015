COGS 121 Assignment 2 - Spring 2015
===========

<h2>
Name: Yusi Liu (Doris)<br>
PID: A97075340
</h2>

<p>Design Principles:</p>

<p>> Consistency: The navigation bar is located on the top section of the page, which is consistent with the standard way of how navigation bars work. Users will find this interface familiar so it won't take much time to learn the system.</p> 

<p>> Visibility: Users can see what functions are available and what the system is currently doing. In the navigation bar, the background color changes to indicate the current page.</p>

<p>> Familiarity: The language and symbols used in this website should all be familiar to the users. There are titles and explanatory text on each page to help the user understand the data visualization.</p>

<p>> Navigation: The navigation bar stays on top of the page across all four visualizations, which makes it easy for the user to navigate and switch between each.</p>

<p>> Responsiveness: When the data visualization graph is loading, there is spinner to indicate the loading status. As user hover on a clickable link or tab, the font or background color changes to inform the user. </p>

<p>> Fitts' Law: All the clickable links have relatively large target size so user can click on nearby area, which saves time.

<p>> Aethetics: The website uses complementary color to provide pleasant reading. The background is simple, which allows the user to focus on the content. </p>
